First time long time

### No more newsfeeds

About a year ago I finally logged off of Facebook for the last time. I had stopped going to it for a few months before that and made the decision to cut it completely. Why? Same story as everyone else I guess. The funny cat videos were no longer worth wading through the toxic septic tank that was my news feed. Sure there were some great posts that were well backed up with articles and gave great view points, but it was mostly people confusing what wouldn't even pass for a coherent meme as trustworthy news. Evidently some people think that the "real journalists" share their big scoops using a low res .jpg with comic sans on a gradient background. And these were people that I had accepted friend requests from. Some of them I'd talked to for 10 minutes or more in real life and didn't think "I need to find a big rock to hit myself with to try to forget the last 15 mintues of my life". 

Anyways, overall I think its been a good call for me, but it honestly does isolate you from people. Which is a win for me. But sometimes I'd like to go see how X is doing, or find their latest contact info, or just keep up to date with any important life events. My friends could get married and I wouldn't know since the letter would be sent to wherever I lived 2 years ago. Someone I used to work with could be arrested for riding a lawnmower drunk to DQ and chill and I wouldn't even hear about it. If we're being honest I would probably be that lawnmower bandit friend that others would read about. Point is I wouldn't want to miss it and I figure by writing a blog I can maybe make sure that people can find about those types of events in my life.

So I guess this is my new social media. Like writing a journal entry and posting it near the cool band posters on the boarded up record store. It's super public and super obscure. Let's see how long it takes to regret.
